WP Rocket – Make WP Load Fast in a Few Clicks,"WP Rocket is a full cache plugin that comes with many features:

Caching of all the pages for quick viewing
Preloading the cache of files using two bots in Python
Reduction of the number of HTTP requests to reduce loading time
Decreasing bandwidth usage with GZIP compression
Management of the headers (expires, etags...)
Minification and concatenation of JS and CSS files
Deferred loading of images (LazyLoad)
Deferred loading of JavaScript files
Simplicity&Speed
Don't waste your time struggling with complex plugin settings. WP Rocket launches upon activation – minimal configuration, immediate results.

Page Caching
Caching creates an ultra-fast load time, essential for improving Search Engine Optimization and increasing conversions. When you turn on WP Rocket, page caching is immediately activated.

Cache Preloading
Because our crawler simulates a visit to preload the cache, the indexing of your website by search engines is instantly improved.

Images on Request
Images are loaded only as your visitor scrolls down the page, improving the load time of the page. YouTube, Facebook, Yahoo and other major websites are using this technique. Now yours can too.

Static Files Compression
WP Rocket reduces the weight of your HTML, JavaScript and CSS files through minification. Lighter files means faster load time!

Developer friendly
WP Rocket’s code is developed according to WordPress best practices. It is clean, commented and has loads of hooks so developers can easily make advanced customizations.

WP Rocket Nulled is the most powerful caching plugin in the world. Use it to improve the speed of your WordPress site, SEO rankings and conversions. No coding required.

WordPress experts recommend WP Rocket to achieve incredible speed results. 40% of people who visit a website will leave it, if it takes more than 3s to load. That’s why every website should be optimized for speed and have a powerful caching system at its core.

It’s no secret: a fast site is more likely to rank higher in search engines.

With page speed being an SEO ranking factor, the faster your pages load, the more Google (and your visitors) will love them.

1 Second Less in page load time leads to:

More Visitors
They will love browsing through you blazing fast pages
Better SEO
Google and other search engines push faster sites up the rankings
More Conversions
A stunning web performance improves conversions and revenue!
Coming from the world of website creation, Jonathan Buttigieg and Jean-Baptiste Marchand-Arvier, creators of WP Rocket have known the issues of long loading times for a while.

Fond of performance, they were frustrated with every existing cache plugin they installed.

In 2013, they developed their plugin: WP Rocket was born. Anyone can use this plugin: you don’t need to have technical skills in web performance to install it and get a fast website.

Web performance is a vast field, full of sometimes tricky and abstract technicalities. For this reason, developers embraced the WordPress philosophy: «Decision, not Options», which means applying what is necessary for the end-user.

Existing solutions are often complex to use and set up for beginners, so our priority is to create an efficient product that is easy to set up on any WordPress site.

A Seamless Configuration for Immediate Speed Results

You don’t need to be a rocket scientist to set up WP Rocket Nulled and benefit from it. The whole process takes 3 minutes flat. No coding required.

Plugin is compatible with your favorite themes and plugins. You can use Divi, Elementor, Yoast SEO, image carousels, social widgets, and all other popular blog themes and plugins without any worries.

Everyone Needs a Fast Website

From personal blogs to big eCommerce stores, WP Rocket is at the heart of any fast website.

To make your website blazing fast, WP Rocket Nulled includes options that provide immediate benefits to your website. These options apply 80% of web performance best practices, so you will benefit from better loading times right away!

Page Caching. Get your WordPress site cached right away. Caching makes your site load ultra-fast: the real key to boost your SEO and increase conversions.

Cache Preloading. Let your visitors enjoy the speedier, cached content of your site right away! WP Rocket automatically preloads the cache every time you make some changes on your web pages.

Browser Caching. Store the frequently accessed resources of your site—images, JS, CSS—in the local memory of the navigation device, be it desktop or mobile.

GZIP Compression. Compress web pages on the server and decompress them in the browser. The size of your files decreases and your visitors get your content quicker.

eCommerce Optimization. Your eCommerce will run fast and smoothly: WP Rocket excludes sensitive pages from the cache. No interference in the purchasing process.

Excellent Compatibility. Enjoy peace of mind: WP Rocket is compatible with the most popular themes and plugins and it works with the top managed WordPress hostings.

Cached Pages, Ultra-Fast Loading Time. Google and other search engines love fast websites. When the loading time of your pages increases, your readers get bored and abandon you. Don’t let this happen: take advantage of caching with WP Rocket!
WP Rocket caches your pages by creating static HTML files and making them easily available for future visitors. It also applies browser caching, asking the browser to store the commonly-used but rarely-updated files in its local cache memory.

Make Your Files Lighter. An optimal loading time also passes from the amount of files that are uploaded to your website.With WP Rocket, you can minify and combine the CSS and JS files of your site, making them faster and lighter and reducing page size.

You can optimize CSS delivery and load JS deferred to eliminate render-blocking resources and improve load time. Besides, delaying the loading of JavaScript files until user interaction will reduce initial load time. No need to touch the code: it’s all done in one click.

Media Files Loaded Only When Needed. WP Rocket includes a smart set of options to tweak the display of images and iframes on your site. With our LazyLoad, you can defer the loading of images or iframes, leaving them ”off-screen” until the users need them. Lazy-loading is a brilliant way of optimizing both perceived and real performance. It also saves the users bandwidth because they won’t have to download all your images! If your site uses WebP images, WP Rocket can also create a separate cache file to serve those, if needed.

Get the Faster Cached Version in a Blink. Cache preloading ensures your visitors get the speedier, cached versions of your site right away. WP Rocket creates the cached versions of your content right upon activation. You can preload your content manually or let WP Rocket do this automatically. Preloading will happen in a blink after WP Rocket clears the cache of posts/pages/custom post types of your site.

Besides, the sitemap-based cache preloading option automatically detects and preloads the sitemaps generated by popular WordPress SEO plugins.

A Tidy Database for a Happy Website. A clean database runs more efficiently and it also helps to speed up your site. WP Rocket provides a dedicated set of options to optimize your database and keep it lean.

You can clean up comments, posts, and transients, optimize your database tables, or schedule automatic cleanups: everything in two clicks.

Reduce Latency and Improve Availability. When your site speaks to a broad international audience, a CDN is key to improve the loading time of your website for visitors that are far away from where your server is located. If you are already using a CDN, you can integrate it in WP Rocket’s dashboard in a few clicks. As an alternative, you can use RocketCDN, WP Rocket’s custom CDN. Forget configuration headaches: the configuration is automatic to provide you with the best speed results.

Give More Power to Your Features:

WP Rocket Add-ons are a set of features that extend available options in very few steps:

Google Tracking
Facebook Pixel
Varnish Cache
Cloudflare integration
Sucuri integration
Control them with a 1-click switch.
Optimization of CSS and JavaScript. Optimizing your WordPress code doesn’t have to give you headaches. WP Rocket makes your files faster and lighter by removing unnecessary elements.

LazyLoad for Images, Iframes, and Videos. Images or Iframes load on the page only when users need to display them. This saves bandwidth, and users can browse the site a lot faster.

WebP Compatibility. WP Rocket creates a separate cache file to serve WebP images to compatible browsers. To ensure compatibility, it detects some of the common plugins you might be using for WebP.

Database Optimization. See, at a glance, how many database tables are available for optimization. You can clean up revisions, trash posts, transients, or let WP Rocket do it for you.

CDN Compatibility. It doesn’t matter what CDN provider you’re using: WP Rocket will work seamlessly with any of them. Activating CDN integration requires only one click.

Browser Caching for Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel. Since you can’t apply browser caching to Google Analytics and Facebook Pixel files, the solution is to host them locally. WP Rocket takes care of this.

Save Coding Time and Give Your Customers the Best Experience. Managing multiple websites can be time-consuming when it comes to performance optimization. With WP Rocket, improving the speed of your websites is automatic: you can deliver outstanding results to your customers by saving lots of time and energy. 80% of web performance best practices are applied immediately after the plugin’s activation.

Customize to Your Liking. Expand WP Rocket functionalities and adapt them to your needs. Use our hooks and filters to customize the caching and optimization features.

Export & Import Your Settings in Two Clicks. Enough with boring configurations to replicate on each site. Apply the same set of optimizations to multiple websites in the blink of an eye.",5,3.12.3,13/11/2022,WP Media,"Cache, Optimizers",Plugins > Caching,https://wp-rocket.me/pricing/,https://wp-rocket.me/
WPMU DEV WP Smush Pro,"The WP Smush Pro plugin allows you to compress images as much as possible through the WordPress manager.

The plugin offers:

сompress images by removing metadata from files with the Jpeg extension;
optimization of data compression in the file;
turning Gif files into indexed PNGs;
size saving is also achieved by stripping unused colors from indexed images.
A simple but effective way to compress images that will be relevant for any site.

This means, that space on hard drive is saved, the site will work with a much lower load time, especially in cases where it stores a huge number of images.

This will be relevant if you need to place a lot of images, but without losing their quality, as well as preserving the original size.

For each product, the site developer will need to place at least 1 image. If the store’s assortment is wide (and this is the main aspect for attracting visitors and increasing sales), it is necessary to show the products from the best side - this is a textual description of the product, characteristics and images of things, that you are selling. With the help of the WP Smush Pro plugin you can download a large number of image, while saving space and site resources maximally.

Wordfence Security Premium,"Protect your websites with the best WordPress security available.
Wordfence includes an endpoint firewall and malware scanner that were built from the ground up to protect WordPress. Our Threat Defense Feed arms Wordfence with the newest firewall rules, malware signatures and malicious IP addresses it needs to keep your website safe. Rounded out by a suite of additional features, Wordfence Premium Nulled is the most comprehensive security option available.

Why choose an endpoint firewall like Wordfence?
Wordfence runs at the endpoint, your server, providing better protection than cloud alternatives. Cloud firewalls can be bypassed and have historically suffered from data leaks. Wordfence firewall leverages user identity information in over 85% of our firewall rules, something cloud firewalls don’t have access to. And our firewall doesn’t need to break end-to-end encryption like cloud solutions.

Stay a Step Ahead of Attackers with Real-time Threat Intelligence
Our data is what makes the firewall and scanner effective, upgrade to Premium to enable real-time protection. If your website is mission-critical you can't afford the downtime, reputation challenges or SEO impact of getting hacked. That's why so many sites rely on the real-time protection provided by Wordfence Premium. Wordfence Premium Nulled provides the real-time endpoint protection you need to protect your mission-critical website. Upgrade to enable these powerful features:

Real-time IP Blacklist. Blocks all requests from IP addresses that are actively attacking WordPress sites protected by Wordfence. Improves protection while improving site performance.
Real-time Firewall Rule Updates. The Wordfence firewall leverages firewall rules to identify and block malicious traffic to your website, protecting you from the latest WordPress attacks and security vulnerabilities.
Real-time Malware Signature Updates. The Wordfence security scanner and firewall rely on thousands of malware signatures to help identify malware on your website and to block malicious uploads.
Reputation Checks. Check to see if your site or IP have been listed on 3 different blacklists for malicious activity, generating spam, or spamvertizing during each scan.
Country Blocking. Designed to stop an attack, prevent content theft or end malicious activity that originates from a geographic region in less than 1/300,000th of a second.
WordPress Firewall
Wordfence includes a Web Application Firewall (WAF) that identifies and blocks malicious traffic. It runs at the endpoint, enabling deep integration with WordPress. Unlike cloud alternatives it does not break encryption, cannot be bypassed and cannot leak data. An integrated malware scanner blocks requests that include malicious code or content. Defends against brute force attacks by limiting login attempts, enforcing strong passwords and other login security measures. Upgrading to Premium enables real-time firewall rule and malware signature updates as well as the Real-time IP Blacklist, which blocks all requests from the most malicious IPs, protecting your site while reducing load.

WordPress Security Scanner
The Wordfence scanner checks core files, themes and plugins for malware, bad URLs, backdoors, SEO spam, malicious redirects and code injections. It also compares your files with what is in the WordPress.org repository, checking their integrity and reporting any changes to you. Repair files that have changed by overwriting them with a pristine, original version and easily delete any files that don't belong. It also checks your site for known security vulnerabilities, abandoned and closed plugins. Content safety checks ensure that your files, posts and comments don't contain dangerous URLs or suspicious content. Upgrading to Premium enables real-time malware signature updates, reputation checks and better control over scan timing and frequency.

Threat Defense Feed
The Threat Defense Feed arms the Wordfence plugin with the newest firewall rules, malware signatures, and malicious IP addresses it needs to keep your website safe. Wordfence protects over 3 million WordPress websites, giving us unmatched access to information about how hackers compromise sites, where attacks originate from and the malicious code they leave behind. Our security analysts and developers are 100% focused on WordPress security, constantly adding updates as they discover new threats.
